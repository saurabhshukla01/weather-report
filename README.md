To create a small weather forecast application that interacts with the OpenWeather API, you can follow these steps using PHP and a popular PHP framework (in this example, we'll use Laravel, but you can choose any other PHP framework of your choice):

Prerequisites:

PHP 8.0 or higher
A PHP framework (e.g., Laravel)
A public GitHub repository to store your code
Docker (for the bonus points)
Webpack (for the bonus points)
Steps:

Set Up Your Development Environment:

Install PHP 8.0 or higher.
Choose and set up a PHP framework (e.g., Laravel, Zend, or any other).
Create a new project or use an existing one.
Get an OpenWeather API Key:

Go to the OpenWeather website and sign up for an API key.
You'll need this API key to make requests to the OpenWeather API.
Implement the Three Screens:
a. Current Weather Forecast:

Create a screen to search for a location and display the current weather conditions, including weather description, current temperature, feels-like temperature, and humidity.
Use the OpenWeather API's "Current Weather Data" endpoint.
b. Next 24 Hours Forecast:

Create a screen that displays the weather forecast for the next 24 hours, including the hour, weather description, and expected temperature.
Use the OpenWeather API's "One Call API" to retrieve hourly data.
c. Next 7 Days Forecast:

Create a screen showing the weather forecast for the next 7 days, including the weekday, weather description, and expected temperature.
Again, use the OpenWeather API's "One Call API" to retrieve daily data.
Integrate with the OpenWeather API:

Make HTTP requests to the OpenWeather API using your API key. You can use PHP libraries like cURL or Guzzle to make these requests.
Create and Store API Requests:

Set up routes and controllers to handle user requests and make API calls.
Create services or repositories to interact with the OpenWeather API.
Handle Responses:

Parse the JSON responses from the OpenWeather API and format the data to display on your screens.
Set Up a Public GitHub Repository:

Create a public GitHub repository to store your code.
Push your project's code to this repository.
Docker Configuration (Bonus):

Set up a Docker configuration to containerize your application.
Webpack (Bonus):

Use Webpack to manage your application's assets.
Add a README.md:

In your GitHub repository, create a README.md file.
Include a brief description of the application, instructions on how to launch the app, and any other relevant details.
Testing and Validation:
Test your application to ensure that it's functioning as expected.
Validate that the screens are displaying the weather data correctly.
Deploy Your Application:
Deploy your application to a web server if needed, and make sure it's accessible to users.
Remember that the choice of PHP framework (e.g., Laravel, Zend) and specific implementation details will depend on your familiarity and preference. The above steps provide a general guideline for building a weather forecast application.

Steps to created Project :

# laravel new weather-project

# php artisan key:generate

# php artisan serve

check file :  AppServiceProvider.php

add code 

inside function boot :

Schema::defaultStringLength(191); // Add this line

write code after that :

# php artisan config:clear
# php artisan cache:clear
# php artisan migrate

-----------------------------------------------------

create controller :

# php artisan make:controller WeatherController


$apiUrl = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=" . urlencode("London,UK") . "&appid=YOUR_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY";

Routes :

currently weather :   http://127.0.0.1:8000/weather-forecast

next 24 hours weather :   http://127.0.0.1:8000/next-24-hours

next 7 days weather :   http://127.0.0.1:8000/next-7-days



++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Create logic and call apis then upload code.

current weather api is working because it free api it will have real data for weather api.
